# RestApi-Application
This is the local application in which we can do CRUD operation using REST API and we are connected to a database and we are connected with a local server like Postman so that we can update , delete ,insert and create the data and from this Postman we will have updated our data to the connected database.
# Example 
## Run the server!
It looks like this and it will run on port 8080 by default.

so by this process we can do changes according to our needs.
Right now this is running on local server but we can deploy this on global.
